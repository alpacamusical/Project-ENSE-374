INSERT INTO 374movies (title,dateReleased,poster,youtube_link,cast,director,rating) VALUES ("Parasite",'2019-05-30', 'parasite.jpg', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/isOGD_7hNIY','Kang-ho Song, Sun-Kyun Lee, Yeo-jeong Jo','Bong Joon-ho','5');

Image for poster must be .jpg currently, resize image dimensions to 800x1200 to ensure css doesnt mess anything up.

For good quality images go to imdb click on the poster there, then right click open image in new tab. Then save image as "movietitle.jpg", change save file type to all files instead of .jpeg.

Youtube link is from youtube video -> share -> embed -> copy ONLY THE URL.

CHMOD 777 *.* in  ,poster folder, from HERCULES so image can be seen.
